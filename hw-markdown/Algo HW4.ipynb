      "Observe that if there are $m$ nodes in level of height $h-1$, then there are at most $2m$ nodes in level of height $h$. And there is only $1$ node in height $0$ (the root of heap), it decuces that we have $2^h$ nodes in height $h$. Note that any node exists in level of hieght $h$ implies that all levels from $0$ to $h-1$ are full (ie. every node in level of height $< h-1$ has two children). Therefore, a heap with height $h$ has $n = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1}{2^k} + N_h$ nodes, where $1 \\leq N_h \\leq 2^h$ means number of nodes in level of height $h$. Then we have\n",
