Thus, for the largest weight edge of $T$, written $(u, v)$, there exists another spanning tree $T'$ of $G$ which contains no edge with weight $\\geq (u,v)$. If $(u, v)$ is removed from $T$, then it consequently cut $T$ into $2$ parts. But since $T'$ is also a spanning tree, we can find another edge $(u', v')$ from $T'$ to connect these $2$ parts and construct a new spanning tree $T''$ with $w(T) > w(T'')$. That implies $T$ is not a minimum spanning tree and leading a contradiction."
